DESCRIPTION
In this project, I designed and implemented an 8-bit Random Access Memory (RAM) using Verilog, a hardware description language, in Xilinx Vivado, a comprehensive development environment for FPGA and SoC design. The RAM has a capacity of 16 words, each 8 bits wide, and supports both read and write operations.I wrote the Verilog code to implement the RAM, using a combination of always blocks and bitwise operators. The code defines the RAM's behavior, including the write and read operations.
When the write enable input (we) is high, the RAM performs a write operation. The data input (data_in) is stored in the location specified by the address input (addr).When the write enable input (we) is low, the RAM performs a read operation. The data stored in the location specified by the address input (addr) is output on the data output port (data_out).I also wrote a testbench to verify the correctness of the RAM implementation. The testbench exercises the RAM by performing a series of write and read operations, and checks that the data is stored and retrieved correctly.
You also wrote a testbench to verify the correctness of the RAM implementation. The testbench exercises the RAM by performing a series of write and read operations, and checks that the data is stored and retrieved correctly.
Xilinx Vivado Simulation
I simulated the RAM implementation using Xilinx Vivado, which allowed you to verify the correctness of the design and test its behavior under different scenarios.
In conclusion, I successfully designed and implemented an 8-bit RAM using Verilog in Xilinx Vivado, which supports both read and write operations. The RAM implementation was verified using a testbench and simulated using Xilinx Vivado.
